Welcome to this short workshop on **Reproducible Research** using [Quarto](https://quarto.org), a next-generation scientific and technical publishing system that integrates code, text, and visualizations.

This session will provide a practical introduction to **reproducible workflows** for scientific and data-driven research.

## Goals of the Workshop {.unnumbered}

- Understand why reproducible research is needed

- Learn the fundamentals of Pandoc and Quarto

- See how to integrate code, data, figures, and references in a single document

- Explore techniques for documenting and sharing scientific results

- Discover how to extend Quarto for advanced use cases

## What Is Reproducible Research? {.unnumbered}

Reproducible research is the practice of producing work that can be **independently verified** and **re-executed** with the same data and code to yield the same results.

- Ensures scientific integrity

- Facilitates collaboration and peer review

- Enhances transparency, longevity, and trust

- **Makes your own work easier to revisit and update**
